      <strong>Uranus</strong> is the seventh planet from the Sun and is
      distinguished by its striking blue-green color, caused by methane in its
      atmosphere. It is an ice giant with a
      <strong>diameter of 50,724 kilometers</strong>, making it the
      third-largest planet in the solar system. Unlike most planets, Uranus
      rotates on its side, giving it a unique axial tilt. Its atmosphere is
      primarily composed of hydrogen, helium, and methane, and it is surrounded
      by a faint system of rings made of dark particles and small moons.
