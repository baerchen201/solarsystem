    <p>
      Venus is the second planet from the Sun and is often called Earth's twin
      due to its similar size and mass. However, its atmosphere is extremely
      thick, trapping heat and making Venus the hottest planet in the solar
      system.

      <strong>Size:</strong> Diameter: 12,104 kilometers (7,521 miles). Mass:
      0.815 Earth masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 108.2 million kilometers (67.2
      million miles).
    </p>

      <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Venus has a thick atmosphere made up mostly
      of carbon dioxide (96.5%) and nitrogen (3.5%), with clouds of sulfuric

      <strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> A day on Venus is longer than a year on

      days to orbit the Sun.
