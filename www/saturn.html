      <strong>Saturn</strong> is the sixth planet from the Sun and is well-known
      for its stunning system of rings. It is a gas giant with a diameter of
      116,460 kilometers, making it the second-largest planet in the solar
      system. The rings are made up of ice, rock, and dust particles, and
      Saturn's atmosphere is primarily composed of hydrogen and helium.
