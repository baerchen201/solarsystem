    <p>
      Mercury is the closest planet to the Sun. It has a very thin atmosphere,
      so it cannot retain heat. The surface temperature varies greatly, reaching
      up to 430°C during the day and dropping to -180°C at night.

      <strong>Size:</strong> Diameter: 4,880 kilometers (3,032 miles). Mass:
      0.055 Earth masses.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Distance from the Sun:</strong> 57.9 million kilometers (36
      million miles).
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Atmosphere:</strong> Mercury has a very thin atmosphere composed
      mainly of oxygen, sodium, hydrogen, helium, and potassium.
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Interesting Fact:</strong> Despite being closest to the Sun,
      Mercury is not the hottest planet. Venus holds that title due to its thick
      atmosphere.
